The primary outcome of this work is a mulitdimensional database of repository temperature 
change per mass of high heat contributing isotopes supporting the implementation 
of the Specific Temperature Change Method in Cyder. 

A validation effort concerning this tool was performed to assess the validity of 
the Specific Temperature Change method for the purpose of repository thermal 
response estimation. 



THE RESULT IS BOUNDED.

% Unit Test Results
For verification of code In addition to the suite of unit tests performed on these analytics which test 
the behavior of the interpolation and specific temperature change algorithms.

% Benchmarking Efforts

Comparing the results of this method with the \gls{LLNL} model gave 
appropriately similar results. 


% Base Case Demonstration ???
The base case demonstration of integration with the Cyclus next generation 
fuel cycle simulator.
