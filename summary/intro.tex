An algorithm and supporting database for rapid thermal repository capacity 
calculation implemented in Cyder, a software library for coupled thermal and 
hydrologic repository performance analysis, is described. Integration of Cyder 
with the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator is also described. Finally, a proof of 
principle demonstration is presented in which the rapid calculation method 
described here is compared with results of a more detailed model.

This algorithm employs a \gls{STC} method 
\cite{radel_effect_2007, radel_repository_2007} and has 
resulted from combining detailed spent nuclear fuel composition data 
\cite{carter_fuel_2011} with a
detailed thermal repository performance analysis tool from 
\gls{LLNL} and the \gls{UFD} campaign \cite{greenberg_application_2012}. By 
abstraction of and benchmarking against these detailed thermal models, Cyder 
captures the dominant 
physics of thermal phenomena affecting repository capacity in various geologic 
media and as a function of spent fuel composition.

Abstraction based on detailed computational thermal repository performance 
calculations has resulted in implementation of the \gls{STC} estimation 
algorithm and a supporting reference dataset.  This method is capable of 
rapid estimation of temperature increase near emplacement tunnels as a function 
of waste composition, limiting radius, $r_{lim}$, waste package spacing, $S$, 
near 
field thermal conductivity, $K_{th}$, and near field thermal diffusivity, 
$\alpha_{th}$.
