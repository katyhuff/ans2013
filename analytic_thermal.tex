  Important heat limits in materials of the repository restrict loading designs 
  and capacity.
  \input{heat_tab}

  Similar heat transport models can be used for all geologies, but are 
  differentiated by material parameters $(c_p, K, \rho)$ and varying 
  thermal limits.

To inform dynamic behavior within the simulator, the repository requires 
a transient model capable of quickly arriving at a heat based 
capacity for an arbitrary waste stream.

  as does a sink facility. It receives materials according to some capacity. The 
  heat-limited capacity of the repository will be reassessed for new waste 
  streams offered to the repository.}}

\subsubsection{Specific Temperature Change Method}
Introduced by Radel, Wilson et. al., the Specific Temperature Change method uses 
a linear approximation to arrive at the thermal loading density limit.  
When the thermal time constant of the rock is much shorter than the waste form 
decay package, the change in package wall temperature can be described by 

\begin{align}
q(t_0)\rho_{limit}C'&=\Delta T_1
\intertext{where}
\rho_{limit} &= \frac{C_1}{Q_1}\nonumber\\
C' &= \mbox{ Thermal constant }[-]\nonumber\\
\Delta T &= T_{lim}-T_{amb}[^{\circ}C]\nonumber\\
T_{lim} &= \mbox{ Temperature limit }[^{\circ}C]\nonumber\\
T_{amb} &= \mbox{ Ambient rock temperature }[^{\circ}C]\nonumber
\end{align}

\caption{\footnotesize{As a demonstration of the calculation procedure, the specific 
temperature change curves, $\Delta t$, are calculated for heat contributing 
isotopes at a 
specified repository spacing, $s$, heat limit radius, $r_{lim}$, and thermal paramters 
$\alpha_{th}$ and $K_{th}$. The total temperature change is the sum of the 
mass scaled curves $\Delta T$.}}

Repeated runs of a detailed analytic model have given a dataset that 
facilitates estimation of thermal loading capacity for a range of thermal 
diffusitivities, conductivities, and repository layouts.
