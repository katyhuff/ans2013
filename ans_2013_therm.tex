\section{Introduction}
% Provide a summary of the work conducted:
%      Describe the technical problem clearly
%      support it with a method

An algorithm and supporting database for rapid thermal repository capacity 
calcuation implemented in Cyder, a software library for coupled thermal and 
hydrologic repository performance analysis, is described. Integration of Cyder 
with the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator is also described. Finally, a proof of 
principle demonstration is presented in which the rapid calculation method 
described here is benchmarked against results of a more detailed model.

This algorithm employs a specific temperature change method 
\cite{radel_repository_2007} and has 
resulted from combining detailed spent nuclear fuel composition data with 
detailed thermal repository performance analysis tools from the \gls{UFD} 
campaign, \gls{LLNL}, and 
\gls{ANL}\cite{greenberg_application_2012,gaski_sinda_1987,carter_fuel_2011}. By 
abstraction of and benchmarking against these detailed thermal models, Cyder captures the dominant 
physics of thermal phenomena affecting repository capacity in various geologic 
media and as a function of spent fuel composition.

Abstraction based on detailed computational thermal repository performance 
calculations has resulted in a Specific Temperature Change (STC) estimation 
implementation and a supporting reference dataset.  This method is capable of 
rapid estimation of temperature increase near emplacement tunnels as a function 
of waste composition, limiting radius, $r$, waste package spacing, $S$, near 
field thermal conductivity, $K_{th}$, and near field thermal diffusitivity, 
$\alpha_{th}$.

\section{Motivation}
% Provide a brief description of the importance of the work (what problem it 
%   addresses/solves):

The United States is simultaneously considering a number of domestic nuclear 
fuel cycle and geologic disposal options.  These decisions are technologically 
coupled by repository capacity. That is, the thermal capacity of a geologic 
repository is a strong function of site geology thermal parameters (see Table 
\ref{tab:heat_tab}) as well as spent fuel composition, which varies among 
alternative fuel cycles. 

\input{heat_tab}

To inform research and development in this coupled system, a generic geologic disposal 
performance model capable of dynamic integration with a systems analysis 
framework is necessary to illuminate capacity constraints and dynamic feedback 
effects of candidate repository geologies in the context of fuel cycle options.
In answer to this need, the algorithm in this work has been implemented in the 
Cyder software library which integrates with the Cyclus computational 
fuel cycle systems analysis platform \cite{huff_cyder_2013,wilson_cyclus:_2012}. 

A generic repository model appropriate for systems analysis must emphasize 
modularity and speed while providing modeling options at various levels of 
detail. Therefore, parameterized simulations and abstraction efforts conducted to develop 
the method described in this work sought to capture the dominant physics of 
thermal repository capacity assessment so that the Cyder disposal environment 
library could meet the simulation speed requirements of the Cyclus fuel cycle 
simulator.

\section{Methodology}
% How did you get such fabulous results?
%       in reproducible detail

% Incorporation in cyclus (discuss capacity estimation, briefly.)
\input{cyder_as_fac}

% Specific Temperature Change
\input{stc}

% LLNL Mathcad Model (range table)
\input{llnlbackground}

% Supporting data from Joe Carter (heat per iso)

% Interpolation (figure this out, or be vague?)

\section{Results and Analysis}
% Provide your results:
%       clearly

The primary outcome of this work is a mulitdimensional database of repository temperature 
change per mass of high heat contributing isotopes as a function of waste
package spacing and thermal parameters of the host geology, $\alpha_{th}$ and $K_{th}$. 
Results of unit tests and benchmarking efforts concerning this tool will be described in this 
section, as will a proof of principle base case demonstration of its use. 

% Unit Test Results

Unit tests are a way to check that your code works. Unit tests performed on 
these analytics tested the behavior of the interpolation and specific 
temperature change algorithms.

% Benchmarking Efforts

Comparing the results of this method with the \gls{LLNL} model gave 
appropriately similar results. 


% Base Case Demonstration ???
The base case demonstration of integration with the Cyclus next generation 
fuel cycle simulator.

\section{Conclusions}
% Was: Importance to Others - Replace with a conclusion.
The Cyder source code in which these models are implemented as well as 
associated documentation are freely available for use by model developers in the 
field of nuclear waste management. The application programming interface to this 
software library is intentionally general to facilitate the incorporation of the 
models presented here within software tools in need of a multicomponent repository 
model.

Furthermore, this work contributes to an expanding ecosystem of computational 
models available for use with the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator. This hydrologic 
nuclide transport library, by virtue of its capability to modularly integrate 
with the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator has laid the foundation for integrated 
disposal option analysis in the context of fuel cycle options.
