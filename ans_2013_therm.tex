\section{Introduction}
% Provide a summary of the work conducted:
%      Describe the technical problem clearly
%      support it with a method

An algorithm for rapid thermal repository capacity calcuation implemented in Cyder, a 
software library for coupled thermal and hydrologic repository performance 
analysis is described. Integration of Cyder with the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator 
is also described. Finally, a proof of principle demonstration is presented in 
which the rapid calculation method described here is benchmarked against results 
of a more detailed model.

This algorithm employs a specific temperature change method \cite{radel} and has 
resulted from combining detailed spent nuclear fuel composition data with 
detailed thermal repository performance analysis tools from the \gls{UFD} 
campaign, \gls{LLNL}, and \gls{ANL}\cite{radel,llnl,sinda,carter}. By 
abstraction of these detailed thermal models, Cyder captures the dominant 
physics of thermal phenomena affecting repository capacity in various geologic 
media and as a function of spent fuel composition.

Abstraction of detailed computational thermal repository performance model 
calculations has resulted in a reference dataset and an associated specific 
temperature change estimation. This method is capable of rapid estimation of 
temperature increase near emplacement tunnels as a function of waste 
composition, waste package spacing, near field thermal conductivity, and near 
field thermal diffusitivity. 

\section{Motivation}
% Provide a brief description of the importance of the work (what problem it 
%   addresses/solves):

Thermal evolution of a geologic repository is a strong function of spent fuel 
composition, which varies among alternative fuel cycles. For this reason, a 
generic disposal model capable of dynamic integration with a systems analysis 
framework is necessary to illuminate capacity constraints and dynamic feedback 
effects of candidate repository geologies in the context of fuel cycle options.
In answer to this need, the algorithm in this work has been implemented in the 
open source Cyder software library which integrates with the Cyclus computational 
fuel cycle systems analysis platform \cite{huff_cyder_2012,huff_cyclus:_2010}. 

A generic repository model appropriate for systems analysis must emphasize 
modularity and speed while providing modeling options at various levels of 
detail. Parameterized simulations and abstraction efforts conducted to develop 
the method described in this work sought to capture the dominant physics of 
thermal repository capacity assessment so that the Cyder disposal environment 
library could meet the simulation speed required by the Cyclus fuel cycle 
simulator.

\section{Methodology}
\input{analytic_thermal}
% How did you get such fabulous results?
%       in reproducible detail

% Specific Temperature Change

% Runs of the LLNL model (range table)

% Supporting data from Joe Carter (heat per iso)

% Interpolation (figure this out, or be vague?)

% Incorporation in Cyder (discuss capacity estimation, briefly.)

\section{Results and Analysis}
% Provide your results:
%       clearly

The primary outcome of this work is a mulitdimensional database of repository temperature 
change per mass of high heat contributing isotopes as a function of waste
package spacing and thermal parameters of the host geology, $\alpha_{th}$ and $K_{th}$. 
Results of unit tests and benchmarking efforts concerning this tool will be described in this 
section, as will a proof of principle base case demonstration of its use. 

% Unit Test Results

Unit tests are a way to check that your code works. Unit tests performed on 
these analytics tested the behavior of the interpolation and specific 
temperature change algorithms.

% Benchmarking Efforts

Comparing the results of this method with the \gls{LLNL} model gave 
appropriately similar results. 


% Base Case Demonstration ???
The base case demonstration of integration with the Cyclus next generation 
fuel cycle simulator.

\section{Conclusions}
% Was: Importance to Others - Replace with a conclusion.
The Cyder source code in which these models are implemented as well as 
associated documentation are freely available for use by model developers in the 
field of nuclear waste management. The application programming interface to this 
software library is intentionally general to facilitate the incorporation of the 
models presented here within software tools in need of a multicomponent repository 
model.

Furthermore, this work contributes to an expanding ecosystem of computational 
models available for use with the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator. This hydrologic 
nuclide transport library, by virtue of its capability to modularly integrate 
with the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator has laid the foundation for integrated 
disposal option analysis in the context of fuel cycle options.
