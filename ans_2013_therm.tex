\section{Conclusions}
% Was: Importance to Others - Replace with a conclusion.
The Cyder source code in which these models are implemented as well as 
associated documentation are freely available for use by model developers in the 
field of nuclear waste management. The application programming interface to this 
software library is intentionally general to facilitate the incorporation of the 
models presented here within software tools in need of a multicomponent repository 
model.

Furthermore, this work contributes to an expanding ecosystem of computational 
models available for use with the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator. The Cyder thermal 
response and hydrologic 
nuclide transport library, by virtue of its capability to modularly integrate 
with the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator, has laid the foundation for integrated 
disposal option analysis in the context of fuel cycle options.
