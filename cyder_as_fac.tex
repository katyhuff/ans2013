\subsubsection{Cyder Integration With Cyclus}

To inform dynamic behavior within the simulator, the repository requires 
a transient model capable of quickly arriving at a heat based 
capacity for an arbitrary waste stream. 

More specifically, the Cyder repository model is a type of Facility within 
Cyclus and interfaces with the simulation by requesting materials from the fuel 
cycle facilities operating simultaneously with it. It the receives materials 
according to the capacity that it defines. In the case of Cyder, the 
heat-limited capacity of the repository will be reassessed for each new waste 
stream composition offered to the repository.
