By this time 5500 thm of vitrified high level waste will have accumulated. Both types of waste will be finally disposed of in one underground repository. Potential host rocks are rock salt, granite and mudrock. Up to now several performance assessment studies have been carried out in order to identify the main parameters governing the long-term safety of such repositories. The disposal concepts investigated differ widely in the water content of the rock formations, the engineered barrier systems and the sorption capacities of the various materials.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}In this paper, it is shown that a previously reported non-linear, one-dimensional, theoretical approximation simplifies -- from a computational point of view -- the calculation of the time-decay temperature field in nuclear waste repositories ({NWR).} This conclusion has been reached after solving, by using the control volume numerical method, the full three dimensional, transient, non-linear heat diffusion equation. The transient thermal field in a rock salt repository, is analytically solved and numerically predicted, along 100 years, after the disposal of a high-level waste ({HLW).} The nuclear waste, with a half-life of 32.9 years, releases an exponentially time dependent heat flux with 12 W m-2 as the initial thermal load. Two cases are studied, in the first one it is assumed that the conductivity (k) and the volumetric heat capacity [rho]cp of the host rock (diffusion domain) remain constant (linear case), whereas in the second one, a more realistic situation is analysed. In this last case, the conductivity of the rock salt varies as a function of the temperature field and the product [rho]×cp remains constant (non-linear case). In order to observe the effect of the salt conductivity (constant or variable) on the repository temperature distribution, a comparison of both cases is performed. It is concluded, that the theoretical model, which provides an analytical solution of the thermal fields may be a powerful low cost method for design purposes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The seven rocks measured were Westerly (Rhode Island) granite, Climax Stock (Nevada) quartz monzonite, Pomona (Washington) basalt, Atikokan (Ontario, Canada) granite, Creighton (Ontario, Canada) gabbro, East Bull Lake (Ontario, Canada) gabbro, and Stripa (Sweden) granite. The diffusivity of all the rocks showed a positive linear dependence on inverse temperature and, excluding the East Bull Lake gabbro, showed a linear dependence on quartz content. (Quartz content varied from 0 to 31\% by volume.) Diffusivity in all cases rose or remained steady with increasing confining pressure. The pressure effect was strongest at lowest pressures and vanished by levels between 10 and 100 {MPa}, depending on rock type. The pressure effect (measured as a percentage change in diffusivity) is stronger in the four rocks of granitic composition than in the three of basaltic composition. Our results agree well with existing thermal diffusivity measurements at atmospheric pressure.},

	volume = {11},
	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AGUFM.T11B0576K},
	abstract = {Thermal and physical properties were measured on 206 Jurassic granite samples obtained from three boreholes in the central part of Korea. Thermal conductivity (λ), thermal diffusivity (α), and specific heat (Cp) were measured in a laboratory; the average values are λ=2.813 {W/mK} (1.962- 3.867 {W/mK)}, α=1.296 mm2/sec (0.93-1.787 mm2/sec), Cp=0.816 {J/gK} (0.750-0.877 {J/gK)}, respectively. In addition, porosity (φ), and dry and saturated density(ρ) were measured; the average values are φ =0.01 (0.002-0.041), ρ (dry)=2.662 g/cm3 (2.540-2.760 g/cm3), and ρ (saturated)=2.67 g/cm3 (2.547-2.771 g/cm3), respectively.  Experimental data show that thermal conductivity increases with increasing thermal diffusivity and decreases with increasing porosity.  However, thermal conductivity does not show good correlation with density. Thermal diffusivities of 10 granite samples were measured with increasing temperature from 25° C to 200° C.  In this study, we found that thermal diffusivity at 200° C is about 30\% lower than thermal diffusivity at 25° C. Using mixing law models, thermal conductivity of a rock sample can be estimated from its mineral contents.  The estimated average thermal conductivity values using a geometric and a square-root mean models are 3.685 {W/mK} and 4.030 {W/mK} with average relative errors of 22.7\% and 33.9\%, respectively.  Granite samples mainly consist of quartz ({\textasciitilde}38 Vol\%, 7.69 {W/mK)} and albite ({\textasciitilde}30 Vol\%, 2.14 {W/mK).}  Two main mineral compositions (quartz and albite) strongly influence thermal conductivity of granite.  A  linear equation including two main components was derived from multiple linear regression (λ=-{0.014·VQuartz-} {0.047·VAlbite+5.0}, where V is Vol\%). Specific gravities were measured on 10 granite samples in the laboratory.  The measured specific gravity ranges from 2.603 to 2.669. The specific gravity depends on chemical compositions of granite. Therefore, specific gravity can be estimated by the felsic-mafic index (F) that is calculated from chemical contents.  The estimated specific gravity ranges from 2.643 to 2.658. The average relative error between measured and estimated specific gravities  is 0.677\%.},

This evaluation was performed to provide information to scientists and decision makers 
to compare candidate geologic media for a repository (crystalline rock [granite], clay, 
salt, and deep borehole), and to provide input for the future evaluation of the trade-off 
between pre-emplacement surface storage time, waste package size, and repository 
footprint.
This approach was selected in favor of the finite element solution typically used to 
analyze the temperature response because it allowed rapid comparison of a large 
number of alternative disposal options and design configurations.  More than 100
combinations of waste form, geologic environment, repository design configuration, and 
surface storage times were analyzed and compared.},

	abstract = {The success of the Soultz-sous-Forêts Hot-Dry-Rock project depends on the ability to maintain fluid circulation in a fractured granite. Fractures represent the main fluid pathways. To understand the behavior of this granite in respect to thermal fluid-rock interaction the important aspects are (1) the porous network around these fractures and (2) the thermal conductivity of the rock. This granite is altered and composed of different weathered facies. Variations of porosity and thermal conductivity take place in regard to the alteration and fracturing of the granite. Two types of porosity measurements were performed, mercury injection and water porosity on two samples sizes. The two methods give similar porosity values between 0.3\% and 10\%. Thermal conductivity measurements were performed in two perpendicular directions to look at anisotropy with two methods at different scale and value ranges from 2.3 to 3.9 W.m-{’.K“’.} Optical scanning provides us with a good knowledge of local increase of thermal conductivity due to sealed fracture or quartz-cemented matrix The relationship between porosity and thermal conductivity is not obvious and has to be studied in details, and results show three cases: a relationship between conductivity and porosity (increase of conductivity with a decrease of porosity) a relationship between conductivity and sealed fractures (increase of conductivity related to an increase of fracture density) and a combination of the two previous ones The results are carefully compared for different types of granite: alterated, fractured or both. These first results indicate that parameters such as thermal conductivity are linked to the porous medium, the structure and the mineralogy of the rock},
